# Snake Game 🐍

This is a simple **Snake Game** built with Python using the `turtle` library. The game is inspired by the classic Snake game where the player controls a snake to collect food, growing in size as they do so. The goal is to score as much as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own body.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Use the **W, A, S, D** keys to control the snake's direction:
   - **W**: Move Up
   - **A**: Move Left
   - **S**: Move Down
   - **D**: Move Right
2. Collect the red food dots to earn points and grow the snake.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
4. The game ends when the snake crashes into itself or the boundary.
